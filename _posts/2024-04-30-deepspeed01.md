## Concepts of Model Parallelism

There are a few concepts that need to be reviewed: DataParallel (DP), 

###  DataParallel (DP)
In DP, the same setup is replicated multiple times, and each being fed a slice of the data. The processing is done in parallel and all setups are synchronized at the end of each training step.

Consider a simple model with 3 layers, where each layer has 2 params:
```bash
La | Lb | Lc
---|----|---
a0 | b0 | c0
a1 | b1 | c1
```

If we have two GPUs, DP splits the model onto 2 GPUs like so:
```bash
GPU0: 
L0 | L1 | L2
---|----|---
a0 | b0 | c0
a1 | b1 | c1

GPU1:
L0 | L1 | L2
---|----|---
a0 | b0 | c0
a1 | b1 | c1
```
Each GPU holds a model, and with every iteration (step), the batch data is divided into 2 equally sized micro-batches. Each GPU independently calculates the gradients based on the micro-batch data it receives. Then the gradient is averaged by the Allreduce algorithm across all GPUs.

## Image Slider

This is a simple image slider. It uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library. Check the [examples page](https://swiperjs.com/demos) for more information of what you can achieve with it.

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>

## Image Comparison Slider

This is a simple image comparison slider. It uses the [img-comparison-slider](https://img-comparison-slider.sneas.io/) library. Check the [examples page](https://img-comparison-slider.sneas.io/examples.html) for more information of what you can achieve with it.

<img-comparison-slider>
  {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/prof_pic.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" slot="first" %}
  {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/prof_pic_color.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" slot="second" %}
</img-comparison-slider>
