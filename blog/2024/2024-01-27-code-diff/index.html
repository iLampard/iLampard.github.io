It is used to split the text into tokens available in the predefined vocabulary and convert tokens strings to ids and back.</p> <p>Shown below, we split a sentence using the GPT-2 tokenizer. “I have an egg” has been split into five tokens, along with the space in between the words and ‘!’ punctuation.
